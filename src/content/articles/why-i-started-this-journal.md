Most developers I know have a graveyard of abandoned blogs. I've been one of them. The usual pattern: get excited, write two posts, realize "nobody's reading this," and stop.

This time is different — because the goal is different.

## This Is a Journal, Not a Blog

I'm not trying to build an audience or become a thought leader. I'm building a habit. Every day I solve problems, learn things, and make decisions that I'll forget by next week. This site is where I capture those experiences before they disappear.

If other developers find it useful, great. But the primary reader is future me.

## What You'll Find Here

I'm a software engineer based in Germany, working on enterprise SaaS products. My days involve a mix of:

- **AI-assisted development** — I use Claude Code extensively in my daily work. How it changes the way I think about problems, where it helps, where it doesn't.
- **Frontend and backend engineering** — Angular, Java, Python, data pipelines. Real patterns from real systems, not textbook examples.
- **Developer tooling and productivity** — What actually makes me faster versus what just feels productive.
- **Debugging stories** — The messy, non-linear process of figuring out why something broke.

## Why Now?

Two reasons.

First, AI tools have changed how I work in ways I couldn't have predicted a year ago. I want to document this shift as it happens — not reconstruct it from memory later.

Second, I've noticed that the best developers I work with share a common trait: they reflect on their work. They don't just ship and move on. They ask "what did I learn?" and "what would I do differently?" This journal is my attempt to build that muscle.

## Let's See Where This Goes

I'm not setting goals for post frequency or subscriber counts. The only commitment is to the habit: capture, reflect, publish. Everything else is a side effect.

If you're a developer thinking about starting something similar — just start. Don't optimize your blog setup for a month. Write the first post. That's what I just did.
