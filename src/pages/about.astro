	<p>
		I'm Kapil, a software engineer based in Germany working on enterprise SaaS products.
	</p>

	<p>
		This site is my developer journal — a place where I document what I learn, build, and debug
		every day. I work extensively with AI-assisted development tools, modern frontend and backend
		frameworks, and data pipelines.
	</p>

	<p>
		You'll find posts about AI-assisted development (particularly Claude Code), engineering patterns
		I discover in daily work, developer tooling and productivity, and the occasional debugging war
		story.
	</p>

	<p>
		The goal is simple: build a habit of capturing experiences that might help other developers — or
		future me.
	</p>
